My grandmother brewing a pot of decaf coffee. The way the buttery crust offsets the tart and gooey baked apples. The whole family together enjoying the ritual. Combined with a generous amount of European butter and sugar, this is what sustains my career.',

        verse:
            'For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.',
